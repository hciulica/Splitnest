## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a fresh graduate student at the computer science faculty with a lot of potential who wants to enter the field of mobile development with enough knowledge about the native react and react framework. I developed the Splitnest application as a bachelor project in order to form a broad knowhow about everything that means the full stack part.
